# My Algorithmic Evolution
Welcome! This repository is a personal journal of my journey through **LeetCode** and competitive programming.

### The Mission
My main goal isn't just to find "the" answer, but to train my brain to think in terms of **Big O Notation** and efficiency. 

In this repo, you'll find my solutions to various challenges. They might not be "perfect" or "industry-standard" from day one, but they reflect my real thought process as I learn to:
- Avoid $O(n^2)$ traps.
- Leverage **Hash Tables**, **Sets**, and **Pointers** for $O(n)$ performance.
- Optimize space vs. time complexity.

### Repository Structure
- **/Easy**
- **/Medium**
- **/Hard**

### Approach
Every solution here is a snapshot of my progress. I try to document why I chose a specific structure and how I'm trying to beat the time/memory limits.
